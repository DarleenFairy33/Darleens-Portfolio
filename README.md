## FAQ

#### "What is the purpose of this website, when you can just publish them seperately on GitHub?"

While yes, i can seperately publish everything on GitHub, it would take *FOREVER* to go through all my repositories, just to find the one you are looking for! so i made a website of all my projects that are, WIP, Still being planned, or Complete in seperate areas!

#### "Who is "Darleen"?"

Me! I'm Darleen. I'm 16, and use She/They pronouns. I develop, and make all my projects from scratch *(mostly)* without the help of AI & other tools. (while I do consider that to be cheating to use AI when coding, you dont have to do what I do at all, its just my personal opinion & preference!)
